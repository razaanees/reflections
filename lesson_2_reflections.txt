Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: When you initialize a repository, it creates a ".git" directory. This is
necessary for tracking the changes in the files because the .git directory
contains metadata of the changes.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area is to organize the files that are snapshotted with each
commit. Using a staging area means that all of the files in the working directory
do no have to be included with each commit.
