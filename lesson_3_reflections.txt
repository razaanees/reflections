Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all of your work local?

A: It would be better to have a remote repo when collaborating with other users
online.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: We might want to pull manually because other users can make changes to the
remote repository. If the local repository was updated automatically, then those
changes would be saved on the machine and over-ride our own changes.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you
use one instead of another?

A: Forks: To create a copy from a GitHub account to your own GitHub account.
Clones: To create a copy of a repository from a GitHub account or a local repo onto
a local disk.
Branches: Diverging commits with some differences between the files. Branches happen
in one repository.

Q: What's the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A: The benefit is that you can check what changes have been made to the repository
while you were offline.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git/GitHub? What would be easier and
what would be harder?

A: Without using either Git or GitHub, I would email project files or share with
a USB drive. It would be harder to identify changes in the project file with other
people without the GitHub version control.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?

A: Changes would be made in a separate branch when you are collaborating on a project
with other contributors. Making changes on another branch allows them to see and
review the changes before they are merged with master.
